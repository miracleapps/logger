# @miraclesoft/logger

Wintson based logger with predefined settings for prod and non-prod environments.

**_Note_**_: This is a beta version of this formatter created for internal use by Miracle Apps, Miracle Software Systems, Inc.'s internal app development wing. Please submit any issues (or) feedback [here](https://github.com/miracleapps/eslint-formatter-html/issues)._

## Usage

Install the logger as a dependency.

```sh
npm install --save @miraclesoft/logger
```

You can then use the logger in your project as follows,

```js
const logger = require('@miraclesoft/logger');

logger.info('');
```

## Configuration

The logger uses environment variables for configuration.

If **NODE_ENV=production**, then logs are logged to a daily rotate log file with the log level set to **warn** and above. For all other environments, the log level is set **info** and are logged out to console.

Log files in production are named as **app-logs-date.log**. You can change this to **APP_NAME-date.log** by setting the **APP_NAME** environment variable.

By default the logger(in production) stores 14 days of logs. This can be overridden by setting the **MAX_LOG_FILES** environment variable.
